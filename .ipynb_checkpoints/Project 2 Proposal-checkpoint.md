# Project Description

Use machine learning to predict movements in the S&P 500 and then implement an algorithmic tradiging strategy in an effort to control downside volitility and outperfom the index.

To accomplish this we plan on:
- Utilize an API to gather historical data on a S&P 500 ETF
- Establish a baseline performance
- Determine the trading signals
- Split data into Training and Testing Datasets
- Determine the best machine learning model to predict trading signals and use those signals to  either 'buy' or 'sell'
- Implement an Algorithmic trading strategy to execute based on the signals determined by our machine learning model.
- Compare our results to the Baseline.
